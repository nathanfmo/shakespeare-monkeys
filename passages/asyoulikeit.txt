All the worlds a stage
And all the men and women merely players
They have their exits and their entrances
And one man in his time plays many parts
His acts being seven ages At first the infant
Mewling and puking in the nurses arms
And then the whining schoolboy with his satchel
And shining morning face creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school And then the lover
Sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress eyebrow Then a soldier
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard
Jealous in honour sudden and quick in quarrel
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannons mouth
