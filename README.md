# Monkeys Writing Shakespeare

## Description:
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem)
, the infinite monkey theorem goes like this: 
> "A monkey
> hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of
> time will almost surely type any given text, such as the complete works of
> William Shakespeare."

This was the inspiration for this project, which posits a derivative of this
theorem. I present, the *finite monkey theorem*:
> "A monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for a **finite**
> amount of time will type out a passage from Shaekspeare, eventually."

This is pretty obvious, if we ignore the factors like monkey lifespan or if
the monkey actually prefers the political intrigue of Tolstoy or the
world-building of Tolkien.

**NOW**, this project seeks to test that theorem by finding the amount it takes
a monkey to type out a passage (excluding punctuation, for now).

## Features:
- A specified number of monkeys, minus any of the downsides of owning monkeys!
- An appropriate number of keyboards
- Passages from various Shakespeare works
- An intern we "borrowed" from the Word spell-checker to keep an eye on the monkeys'
progress

## How to Use:
Download the project
#### User Input
$ ./GoMonkeysGo.java `shakespearetext` `numberofmonkeys`

#### Program Output
Oohooh Aahaah! It would take `numberofmonkeys` `time` to write `shakespearetext`

## Technology Used:
- About 11 keyboards we found from a dumpster
- Premium, steel-reinforced intern-catching net
- Monkey language translator that we promised we wouldn't share, sorry :0(

## License
Yes
